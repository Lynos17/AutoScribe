PHILOSOPHER: Yes. I have a young friend who dreams of becoming a novelist, but he never seems to be
able to complete his work. According to him, his job keeps him too busy, and he can never find enough
time to write novels, and that’s why he can’t complete work and enter it for writing awards. But is that
the real reason? No! It’s actually that he wants to leave the possibility of “I can do it ifI try” open, by not
committing to anything. He doesn’t want to expose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’t want
to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection. He wants to live
inside that realm of possibilities, where he can say that he could do it if he only had the time, or that he
could write if he just had the proper environment, and that he really does have the talent for it. In
another five or ten years, he will probably start using other excuses like “I’m not young anymore” or

“T’ve got a family to think about now.”
